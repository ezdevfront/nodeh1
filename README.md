# nodeh1
nodeh1 is a runnable node.js httpAPI for the first assignment in "Node master class" at "pirple.com". A very nice in-depth course
about the node.js runtime and libraries.

Homework1 is a simple http RESTAPI which listen on port 3000 and replies a JSON formated object on the path "/hello"
There is also a path /bananas added just for fun. Consists of 2 files:
-homework1.js
-config.js

So to run: Dowload files and run with Node. NodeJS has to be installed on your system. 
-Node homework1.js
Use browser, postman or curl with terminal to hit: http://localhost:3000/hello or http://localhost:3000/bananas to view result.
